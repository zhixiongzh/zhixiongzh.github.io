I am a third-year PhD candidate co-advised by [Prof. Dr. Mario Fritz](https://cispa.saarland/group/fritz/) at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) and [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), and [Dr. Maria-Irina Nicolae](https://ririnicolae.github.io/) at [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)](https://www.bosch-ai.com/). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the Technical University of Munich in Germany, and Bachelor's degree in Automotive Engineering from Tongji University in Shanghai, China.

My research interest lies on trustworthy machine learning, with an emphasis on evaluating LLM-based systems for reliability, defending against system prompt extraction in large language models, and understanding model vulnerabilities to extraction attacks.
