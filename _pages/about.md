I'm a second-year PhD candidate at [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)](https://www.bosch-ai.com/). My research interest lies on trustworthy machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mario Fritz](https://cispa.saarland/group/fritz/) at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) and [Dr. Maria-Irina Nicolae](https://ririnicolae.github.io/) at [BCAI](https://www.bosch-ai.com/).

Before joining BCAI, I earned a Master's degree from the Technical University of Munich in Germany, and a Bachelor's degree from Tongji University in Shanghai, China.
